# 00 - Deep Learning and TensorFlow Fundamentals 🧠⚙️

This notebook is the **first part** of a deep learning tutorial series focused on building strong foundations using TensorFlow.

## 📚 What's Covered

- What is a Tensor?
- Tensor ranks and shapes
- Tensor creation with `tf.constant`, `tf.zeros`, `tf.ones`, `tf.range`
- Reshaping and type casting
- Expanding and squeezing dimensions with `tf.expand_dims()` and `tf.squeeze()`
- Understanding axis values (positive and negative)
- Tensor indexing and slicing
- TensorFlow random seed: global vs operation level
- Hands-on code + visual explanations

## 📌 File Name
`00_DeepLearning&TensorFlowFundamentals.ipynb`

This notebook is structured for both **learning and revision**, with examples that help you visualize how tensors work under the hood.
To give a solid starting point in Deep Learning by exploring how data is represented and manipulated in TensorFlow.
💡 This is part of a larger deep learning roadmap. Stay tuned for more notebooks covering model building, loss functions, optimizers, and real projects!


## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
